                Startup India recognition opens up avenues for funding, both
                from the government and the private sector. The government has
                launched several funds, such as the Fund of Funds for Startups
                (FFS), to provide financial support to recognized startups.
                Additionally, startups gain visibility among angel investors,
                venture capitalists, and other funding sources, increasing their
                chances of securing investments.
